title: Becoming Something of a 'Wiki'
date: 2020-12-03

A decent amount of time has passed since my last (and initial) blog post, most of which I can blame on work taking up far too much of my time, and then the ensuing burnout making it difficult to do much of anything 'productive.' 

With that being said, I'm not entirely sure how of a blogger I really am, and giving status updates about what I'm up to does feel a little strange! Still, I wanted to have some sort of post that describes what I'm going to work on next, and that is some sort of a wiki that will cover topics I'm familiar with. 

During my time at college, I had two jobs: working full-time as a customer service associate at a convenience store on the east coast called Wawa, and then working as a tutor at the community college nearby. I genuinely enjoyed that work, and liked being able to help people progress in their studies. 
 
While continuing that into a career wasn't something I really though about, I always wanted to create an online resource that students can use to help them with their classes. While yes, dozens of this exact same thing already exist, it feels like it's something that can be done better. What I see is someone being able to gain some knowledge and understanding on a large variety of fields, which are based on what classes I have taken in the past, and what classes I'll be taking in the future.

I'm hoping that I can help guide someone that is pursuing a similar degree, or maybe serve as a well-written resource for people that are curious.

I'll be starting off with (Financial Accounting)[https://ppejovski.github.io/blog/financial-accounting] for the first subject, which seems fitting.
