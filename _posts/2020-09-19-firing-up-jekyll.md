Safe to say this [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by Jonathan McGlone made installing Jekyll within GitHub Pages a hell of a lot easier compared to my failed attempt at installing it on my own machine yesterday. While installing Jekyll on my own machine is probably the better idea, I think I'll just try to manage it with GitHub Desktop for the time being.
