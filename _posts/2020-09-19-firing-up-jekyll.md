title: "Firing up Jekyll"

Safe to say this [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by Jonathan McGlone made installing Jekyll within GitHub Pages a hell of a lot easier compared to my failed attempt at installing it on my own machine yesterday. While installing Jekyll locally is probably the better idea, I think I'll just try to manage it with exclusively GitHub for the time being. I'm thinking I'll give it a more honest attempt when I have a bit of a better understanding on how Ruby actually works.
